# Factorio-RaiLuaLib
LUA library for my Factorio mods. Others are free to use it if they want, but I made it for myself.

Documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/raiguard/Factorio-RaiLuaLib/wiki).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug, or if you wish for something to be added to the lualib, go ahead and make a pull request. I want to keep this lualib as lean as possible, so please avoid added supurfluous features.
